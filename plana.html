          Plan A is a single-person bullet-hell game that was developed for the Sex Positive Game Jam at NYU in 2017. I worked on a two-person team with Elliot Winch to develop the game in Unity (C#).
          <br>
          <br>
          The game educates players on the benefits of using contraceptives, and the side-effects that can be expected from them.
