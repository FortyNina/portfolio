          You Up? is a narrative game about dating in the modern world, based on a true story (mine!). It was developed in Swift for iOS. You play as a college student, looking for love on a dating app after a break up. Swipe casually, talk with your matches, and plan dates. The game takes a dark turn that reveals the reality of talking to strangers on the internet.

          You Up? was developed by a three-person team for the 2018 Global Game Jam. I was the lead designer, Elliot Winch was lead developer, and Carlos-Michael Rodriguez was lead writer.
