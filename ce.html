        Users redeem tickets to Club Eternal through the Eternal+, a ticketing app made in Swift that also has ticket releases for IRL events. Users can then enter Club Eternal through the app whenever a virtual event is taking place. I worked closely with our iOS team to integrate the Club Eternal Unity build within the iOS Swift app.

        I joined the company in July 2020 as a contract Unity developer and started fulltime in February 2022. We started working on this iteration of Club Eternal in January 2022 and I saw it through to its first launch in December. My primary areas of focus on the project so far have been UI, camera, movement, social interactions like chat + friending, and login/authentication flows.

        As we continue to build the product, I plan to add photos and gifs to the following archives so I have documentation of the app's growth.
