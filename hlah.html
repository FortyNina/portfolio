          "Hunt Like a Hammerhead" is an interactive experience where users steer a hammerhead shark through an ocean environment and hunt for stingrays. The game uses an Ultrahaptics board from Ultraleap for the controls. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The piece is a part of the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s special exhibition, "Sharks", which opened in December of 2021. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I worked on a small team at AMNH to create Hunt Like a Hammerhead. I worked in Unity, using C#, to develop the gameplay logic and movement for the shark.
