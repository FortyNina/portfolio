          Color Play is a set of interactive scenes that allow the user to play and experiment with color. Players are tracked in the play area using a depth sensor, and their motion and actions affect the dynamic graphics rendered on the wall and floor. A touch screen kiosk gives users the ability to change the color palette used in the scenes.

          The piece is a part of the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s special exhibition, The Nature of Color, which opened in early March of 2020.

          I worked on a small team at AMNH to create Color Play. I mainly developed in Unity, using C#, to create the four unique scenes and their visual effects and transitions. I also worked on the kiosk that allows users to change the color scheme of the piece.
