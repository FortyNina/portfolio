    <!--Expansion warnings-->
    <div id = "post">
      <div class = "entry-title"> RED PLANET FARMING - EXPANSION WARNINGS</div>
      <div class = "date-title"> Nina Demirjian - January 18 2020</div>
      <div class = "body-title">
        In my last post I briefly described that some players were unhappy with the sudden expansion of the settlement in their plots of land, plowing over everything they had built. For a while, this was a mechanic that I stood behind, but I am starting to see the light.
        <br>
        <br>
        Basically, when players build up their population, the city expands and removes any crops, upgrades, or buildings that they had placed there. Originally this was supposed to be a way to keep players from expanding too fast, and to give them a sense that their settlement really was growing thanks to their hard work. Unfortunately, I think this has been causing a lot of frustration. And I understand why — Red Planet Farming is a strategy game, and people don’t want to feel like the farm that they’ve planned and built up is just being taken away from them. Ultimately, the expanding city was doing a lot to work against the rest of the design of the game.
        <br>
        <br>
        That all being said, I think the city expansion is still worth keeping in the game, to a degree. I’ve made some changes over the past few days that I really hope enhance the gameplay experience without having to sacrifice the (in my opinion funny) colonists taking over the player’s plots. This includes having the city prioritize expanding into empty plots that the player hasn’t built on, and giving the player a warning for where the city will expand. I’ve attached an image below of how the UI for this all looks:

        <img src= "assets/blog/01-18-20_00.jpg" class = "body-image">

        The plot with the yellow and black stripes is due for expansion. The player can still plant and place stuff on it this year, but next year, the city will expand and demolish everything that was on the field. The player can either remove everything on the plot and get some of their money back, or they can plant something and have it grow there, but the plot won’t be theirs again next year. 
        <br>
        <br>
        In addition to this, I’ve also scaled back the number of times that the city expands. To be honest, I think I had a bug in the code before, and that’s why it was expanding so quickly. But I think I’ve ironed it out and have a pretty fair system in place now for the expansions.

        Hello all, long time no post! We have been really busy with the holidays, MAGFest, and, of course, RPF development.

        <img src= "assets/blog/01-16-20_00.jpg" class = "body-image">

        We are really grateful that we were able to attend MAGFest this year. It was our first time ever showing a game! There were a lot of people that came through and played, and the reactions were mostly positive.
        <br>
        <br>
        That being said, there were a lot of comments about the expansion part of the game. People were pretty upset when the city expanded over their plots, and I understand that they were upset that it felt like the game was messing with their strategy. I’m now realizing that the expanding city was a bit trolly on my part and I really just liked watching people get annoyed, but I think that is not a good enough reason to keep this feature.
        <br>
        <br>
        Anyways, here are some more recent screenshots of RPF below. We are working on getting all of the art for Gale Crater in:

        Our artist Sean Park has been working on some visual effects for all of the different weather patterns in the game. So far, he has done dust storm and solar flare particles, and they are making the simulation phase of the game a lot more exciting to watch! He put together these demo scenes of all the particles:

        <img src= "assets/blog/11-20-19_00.gif" class = "body-image">
        <img src= "assets/blog/11-20-19_01.gif" class = "body-image">

        I think my personal favorites from these are the lightning bolts in the dust storm and the distortion effect on the solar flare. I’ll probably end up putting the distortion effect on the cold snap systems too.
        <br>
        <br>

        Here is some content from the game itself:

        <img src= "assets/blog/11-20-19_03.gif" class = "body-image">

       Up next we have some landslide and marsquake effects in the works. Based on the way the dust and solar effects turned out, I think they’ll probably look really good! I was doing some research on landslides and how the rocks fall so I could create a moodboard of landslide visuals as inspiration, and stumbled across 
       <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5sqfUKEGx9Q"> this WILD video on youtube. </a>
       Go to time marker 1:31 its literally the craziest thing I’ve seen. And landslides are probably even more dramatic on Mars because there aren’t any trees with roots to help keep the dirt in place! 
       <br>
       <br>
       Anyways I will make another post once the landslide and marsquake effects are in the game!

        Ok so I’ve actually had the fourth region, Medusae Fossae, implemented for a while now but never made a post about it because I didn’t get around to taking decent photos of it, and it was also not really playable. Its not actually that playable now either, but I’m working on it! This region, along with Utopia Planitia, definitely need a lot of work to catch up to Valles Marineris and Gale Crater, but that’s a priority for me in the next few weeks because I’m starting to get nervous overall about the state of this game currently and how quickly our expected launch times are approaching.

      <div class = "entry-title"> RED PLANET FARMING - Dramatic Before and After</div>
      <div class = "date-title"> Nina Demirjian - November 17 2020</div>
      <div class = "body-title">
        Today I have an extremely dramatic set of before and after images of the information popups for the seeds, upgrades, and buildings. The “before” images are from the original version of the game that we submitted for the Sloan Grant, and the “after” images are from today.
        <br>
        <br>
        Here are the before/after for the seed popups:

        <div class = "flex-container">
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_00.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_01.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
        </div>

        Here are the before/after for upgrade popups:

        <div class = "flex-container">
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_02.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_03.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
        </div>

        Here are the before/after for building popups:

        <div class = "flex-container">
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_04.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_05.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
        </div>

        And finally, the before/after for field popups:

        <div class = "flex-container">
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_06.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
          <div class = "flex-item-snapshot">
            <img src="assets/blog/11-17-19_07.png" class = "grid-image">
          </div>
        </div>

        I think it’s a bit funny to see what has and hasn’t changed in these images over time. I think the most important improvement here is the new consistency with the icons used in all of the popups. I tried to incorporate icons so that the player will have a better sense understanding how they can protect their crops. All of the popups use these icons to describe their functions.
        <br>
        <br>
        I think it’s likely that the popups will continue to evolve, but not drastically. I personally think the Plot Overview feels a bit empty. Or maybe not. It just feels like something is off.
        <br>
        <br>
        I’m also not married to these colors. Of course, the colors change region by region, so it will take some time to match the colors to each region specifically.

        Today and yesterday I have been trying to give the game some added visual effects to enhance player experience. Also, a lot of people have been complaining that its not clear that crops get automatically harvested at the end of each year, so I decided to kill two birds with one stone:

        <img src= "assets/blog/11-04-19_00.gif" class = "body-image">

        As you can see I’ve decided to spice up the end of the year by having each field spit out some crops to represent a harvest. To do this, I simply made a particle system in Unity that plays briefly on each field, assigning a material with the specified crop to the system.

        <img src= "assets/blog/11-04-19_01.gif" class = "body-image">

        Also here are some funny “bloopers” if you will from when I was testing this feature:

      <div class = "date-title"> Nina Demirjian - October 20 2020</div>
      <div class = "body-title">
        Hey all. Nina here. I’ve spent this past weekend working for three straight days on Red Planet Farming to prepare for a stream tomorrow (post about that to follow). Anyways, one of the things Noah was working on lately is some new UI so I just thought I’d show it off here. I’ve also been taking photos like these lately because I need to submit some photos to one of my advisors, who is going to make a post about Red Planet Farming on the Game Center website!

        <img src= "assets/blog/10-20-19_00.png" class = "body-image">

        You might be able to see here that I’ve also added a new feature, which is present in the UI on the right. There is now a display that shows the player the ESTIMATED amount of food that they will make that year based on the crops that they have planted. 
        <br>
        <br>
        That estimate, however, does not take into account what will happen if the crops are damaged. So, if the player doesn’t protect their crops, this number will actually be far lower at the end of the year.
        <br>
        <br>
        This feature threw me through a few hoops to implement. I started off by updating this number every time a player purchased/removed a crop. But the weirdest thing started happening! Plots were disappearing, purchased land wasn’t saved, and headquarters sprites weren’t appearing. I never actually figured out what was going on; mostly because I needed to focus my time on preparing for the stream, and not fixing this bug. So instead, I just implemented the feature in a slightly different, slightly (I think) less-efficient way, but at least now its working!

        Today was quite an exhilarating day for me. I’ve traveled out to California in order to meet with the science advisors we’ve been working with that are at the NASA Ames Research Center.
        <br>
        <br>
        I got to meet not only with my advisors, but with some other Mars experts, including a duststorm expert! They all had a lot of interesting ideas for things to put in the game. I’ll list a few:
        <br>
        <pre>
        -Dust devils
        -Bees
        -Edible tarantulas (!!)
        -Algae tanks
        -Plum trees to stop bone deterioration (!!)
        -Cell cultures to grow meat
        -Planetary Protection Laws
        </pre>
        Anyways, it looks like I have my work cutout for me! It was a successful day and I feel excited about everything that was suggested today, but I also feel a bit overwhelmed. I’m now going to visit my brother, who also lives in California, for a few days, and I’m aiming to not touch the game in that time. I worry that working on it too much everyday is halting productivity, so I’m taking a break this weekend. But I’ll be back in action next week to prepare for our stream on Death By Audio!

        Hello all. Very exciting post today. I want to introduce Sean Porio, who is the sound designer for Red Planet Farming. He’s been working with us for a while now, but I have some demos of some soundtracks for the game that we want to share now:

        <br>
        This is a demo for Valles Marineris, which I AM EXTREMELY HAPPY WITH. I think its sounds wonderful! I’m very excited to see (or i guess hear) how the rest of the soundtrack turns out!
