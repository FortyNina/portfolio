          A large-scale, interactive floor projection for the American Museum of Natural History's special exhibit, Unseen Oceans. Opened March 2018.

          Abundance is a set of two large-scale floor projects. Each projection uses a Kinect to track the movement of visitors. Schools of fish flock and swim together in a circle, but will swim away from tracked visitors. 
          <br>
          <br>
          Abundance is a piece about conservation and overfishing in oceans. Too much "human activity" will cause the fish to quickly swim away and disappear from the screen. 
          <br>
          <br>
          The piece is a part of the American Museum of Natural Historyâ€™s special exhibition, Unseen Oceans, which opened in early March of 2018. 
          <br>
          <br>
          I worked on a small team at AMNH to create Abundance. We worked in Processing (Java) to develop the piece.
